Weight Converter 

Jan 19, 2019: 
This is a simple vanilla javascript Application to convert (currently) from Pounds to Grams, Kilograms, and Ounces.


01/31/2019 Update: 
Trying to figure out how to change the Pounds input field to one of the other three weight measurements (Grams, Kilograms, Ounces) via a dropdown menu. Then calculate how to convert that measurement to the other three remaining weight measurements.

Example: 
Change to Grams, and convert to Pounds, Kilograms, Ounces.
Change ot Kilograms, and convert to Pounds, Grams, Ounces.
etcâ€¦.
